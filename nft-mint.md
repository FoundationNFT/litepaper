## Post Mint

The launchpads selection process will be 100% in the hands of the community. This will be done fairly and transparently by voting via the DAO model - each vote will be registered on the blockchain.

Each NFT will have equal voting power, and thus will represent 1 of 7777 votes. The voting will be conducted for the sole purpose of selecting the desired launchpads by the community.

The end goal is to get the highest tier on the most requested launchpads.
