# Welcome to Foundation

## Introduction

The majority of people enter the crypto industry after hearing about other people's massive gains. From DOGE millionaires to teens trading NFTs, everyone seems to be getting wealthy except you.

The truth is that most people who have earned significant gains have done so through a combination of time, money, or ignorance, as well as luck and diamond hands.

If you already have money, you can invest in pre-sales, ICOs, nodes, yield farms, or simply stake and earn a good APY on your fiat if you started in crypto 10 years ago.

So, where are the 10x and 100x returns that everyone is raving about? The solution is to provide seed money. Call it a pre-sale, an ICO, an IDO, an IGO, or whatever you want. You must bet on a company before the general public.



### Ways to invest before the general public

Usually, the best stage to invest in a project is through private seed investment. These are investors that have great networks and are pitched ideas and projects very early in their development. The barrier to entry is very high because you need to have: big capital that usually retail investor does not possess and exclusive connections in the WEB3 (CEOs, advisors, founders...)

After initial private rounds are secured at the lowest price possible, the next chance to invest is obtained by launchpads/very limited general public. In this case barrier to entry is lower but still requires you to buy at least $3,000 - $10,000 worth of the platform's tokens to get access to the sales.

Finally, tokens can be bought from DEXs and CEXs by everybody.



### Where we fit in?

At Foundation we believe that investing should be easy and available to **everyone**. That's why we will grant access to the retail through our NFT by optimizing the launchpad experience for people with not a lot of capital but still interested to support early-stage projects.

## Our Mission

Help our NFT community realize its dreams by providing an opportunity to participate in all exclusive ICO/IDO/IGOs and seed rounds of different projects. **We want to allow little fish to swim alongside whales without being crushed.**



### Problem

Even if you have $10,000 or $20,000 on hand, investing a significant portion of your funds in a new endeavor is quite dangerous. People who invest in these ventures (at least the wise ones) don't have 5-digit portfolios since it's too risky. Moreover, first, you need to spend 50% of your budget just to buy launchpad tokens, which can depreciate while you're holding them. As a result, the vast 10-100x returns are out of reach for the average retail investor.



### Solution

Foundation NFT will grant you access to an exclusive community that has a reserved place in any project that the community votes for/agrees on. This will be done by getting the highest tiers on launchpads using the proceeds from the NFT minting phase. Your NFT will be your pass into the investor hub with limitless possibilities.
